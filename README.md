# Jupyter-Exploration Lab Session

## Overview
This lab session focuses on mastering the fundamentals of GitHub, the industry-leading platform for version control and collaborative software development. Through hands-on exploration, it helped in setting up and managing a GitHub repository, make commits, and manage changes efficiently. 

The session begins with creating a GitHub account and familiarizing oneself with the GitHub interface, exploring key features such as repositories, issues, and pull requests. Next, we created a new repository named "jupyter-exploration" and initialize it with a README file. Finally, made our first commit by editing the README to include a brief description of the lab session. By the end of this exercise, gained preliminary working knowledge of GitHub's core functionality and how it serves as a cloud-based hosting platform that enables developers to manage, track, and version their source code effectively.

## Lab Deliverables
- Created and configured a GitHub account
- Explored the GitHub interface and its core features
- Understood basic version control concepts
- Learned about repositories, commits, and basic GitHub workflows
- Practiced making changes and committing them to a repository
- Gained practical experience with GitHub's collaborative features

## Conclusion
GitHub as a cloud-based platform built on Git version control, provides a robust environment for both individual developers and teams to track changes, collaborate on projects, and maintain code history.This repository serves as a practical demonstration of the concepts covered in our lab session, providing hands-on experience with GitHub's fundamental features and workflows.

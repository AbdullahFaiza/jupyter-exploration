# Jupyter-Exploration
### (Bonus Points Tutorial - Intro to Jupyter and GitHub )

## Overview
This session focuses on mastering the fundamentals of GitHub and Jupyter Notebooksâ€”two essential tools in modern programming and data science. Through hands-on exploration, it helped in setting up and managing a GitHub repository, making commits, and managing changes efficiently.

The session begins with creating a GitHub account and familiarizing oneself with the GitHub interface, exploring key features such as repositories, issues, and pull requests. A new repository named "jupyter-exploration" was created and initialized with a README file. Finally, made first commit by editing the README to include a brief description of the lab session.

In the second part, explored interactive computing through Jupyter Notebooks using Google Colab, AWS SageMaker Studio Lab, and a local Jupyter installation. During this segment, created and executed markdown and code cells, saved notebook, and uploaded to the GitHub repository using GitHub Desktop.

## Lab Deliverables
- Created and configured a GitHub account
- Explored the GitHub interface and its core features
- Understood basic version control concepts
- Learned about repositories, commits, and basic GitHub workflows
- Practiced making changes and committing them to a repository
- Gained practical experience with GitHub's collaborative features
- Created and ran a Jupyter Notebook with Markdown and Python cells
- Used online and offline environments (Colab, SageMaker, Jupyter)
- Saved and uploaded notebook to GitHub using GitHub Desktop

## Conclusion
GitHub, as a cloud-based platform built on Git version control, provides a robust environment for both individual developers and teams to track changes, collaborate on projects, and maintain code history. Combined with Jupyter Notebooks, it forms a powerful workflow for writing, executing, and sharing interactive code. This repository serves as a practical demonstration of these foundational tools and workflows.
